    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY OF CHAT VERSE</h1>
    <P>At Chat Verse, your privacy is our highest priority. We are committed to protecting and safeguarding the personal information you share with us. When you use Chat Verse, we may collect basic information such as your name, phone number, email address, profile picture, and device details to provide you with a seamless messaging experience. All your messages, calls, media, and shared content are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that only you and the person you're communicating with can read or listen to what is sent â€” not even Chat Verse can access this content. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. We only use your information to improve app performance, enhance security, prevent spam or abuse, and introduce new features that make your experience better. Your data is securely stored using advanced encryption methods, and we implement strict security measures to protect against unauthorized access or data breaches. You are always in control of your information, and you can update or delete your account data at any time through the app settings. By using Chat Verse, you agree to this privacy policy and our commitment to transparency, trust, and respect for your personal information. If we make any significant changes to our privacy practices, we will notify you promptly through the app or by email.</P>
